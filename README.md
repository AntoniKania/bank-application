# Spring Boot Bank Application

### Welcome to our powerful and user-friendly Spring Boot bank application!

Built using the MVC pattern, our application offers a wide range of features that are designed to make managing your finances easy and convenient.

At the core of our application is the **BankService** class, which serves as the controller and allows for the creation of new users, placement of deposits, and initiation of transfer orders.
One of the unique features of our application is the ability to initiate transfer orders in such a way that the specified amount is only subtracted from the sending account and no account is credited with the transferred funds.
This feature is especially useful for businesses that need to make payments to vendors or suppliers on a regular basis.

To run the application, simply clone the repository and run the command `mvn spring-boot:run` in the root directory.
Our application is built with security and scalability in mind, making it the perfect choice for businesses of all sizes.
